# 🌱 Learn45 — Build Your Daily Learning Habit

**[Learn45.com](https://www.learn45.com)** — a personal learning companion built to help you learn for **just 45 minutes a day**, every day.

> ⚡ Designed, built, and deployed solo — by a developer obsessed with learning systems and elegant architecture.

## 🧭 The Vision

I’ve always believed consistent learning beats random intensity.  
**Learn45** is my attempt to turn that idea into a real, usable product — something that makes *growth a habit*, not a chore.

It’s not just code. It’s a philosophy wrapped in a product.

---

## 🧠 Tech Core

Built with a production-grade stack — simple, fast, and scalable.

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Framework | **Next.js (App Router)** |
| Language | **TypeScript** |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** |
| Deployment | **Vercel** |
| Font | **Geist – by Vercel** |
| Architecture | Component-driven, modular, server-first mindset |

I’ve treated this like a **real product**, not a side experiment — focusing on clean architecture, developer velocity, and extensibility.

## 💡 Why I Built It

Every engineer has side projects.  
**Learn45** isn’t just another one — it’s my sandbox to explore how **habit formation**, **micro-learning**, and **software design** intersect.  

It’s also where I experiment with ideas that could evolve into startup-scale products.
