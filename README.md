# Learn45 — One Habbit, Endless Growth 

**[Learn45.com](https://learn45.com/)** — a personal learning companion built to help you learn anything for **just 45 minutes a day**, every day.

⚡ Why 45 minutes? — chosen for a reason. It’s the global learning rhythm that maximizes focus, mirrors classroom flow, and builds lasting consistency.

## 🧭 The Vision

I’ve always believed consistent learning beats random intensity.   
**Learn45** is my attempt to turn that idea into a real, usable product — something that makes *growth a habit*, not a chore.

It’s not just code. It’s a philosophy wrapped in a product.

## 🔬 Highlights

- ⚙️ End-to-end **Next.js App Router** setup (API routes, layouts, metadata)  
- 🧩 Modular design — ready for multi-user expansion  
- 🧠 Clean mental models for scalable React state management  
- ✨ Fully typed with **TypeScript** for predictable refactors

## 💡 Why I Built It

Every engineer has side projects.  
**Learn45** isn’t just another one — it’s my sandbox to explore how **habit formation**, **micro-learning**, and **software design** intersect.  

It’s also where I experiment with ideas that could evolve into startup-scale products.
